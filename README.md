# Kubernetes-End-to-End-Project-on-EKS
Kubernetes End to End Project on EKS: App Deployment with Ingress
Project Overview
In this project, I deployed a Kubernetes cluster on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and implemented an end-to-end solution for deploying and exposing an application using Kubernetes Ingress. The project demonstrates my expertise in Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure, and application deployment on AWS.

Objectives
Set up a fully functional Kubernetes cluster on AWS using EKS.
Deploy a sample application on the cluster.
Expose the application using a Kubernetes Service.
Implement Ingress to manage HTTP/HTTPS routing and load balancing for the application.
Tools & Technologies Used
Amazon EKS: Managed Kubernetes service on AWS.
Kubernetes: Orchestration platform for containerized applications.
AWS CLI: Command-line interface for AWS.
eksctl: A simple CLI tool to manage EKS clusters.
kubectl: Command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.
NGINX Ingress Controller: Used for managing Ingress resources.
Helm (optional): For easier deployment of applications.
